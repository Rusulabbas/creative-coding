    <!--
    
        This is my (Rusul Abbas) interpretation of the Concrete Manifesto exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1499064/assignments/11895963
 
        This statement is from Milton Glaser https://designmanifestos.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/essays-10things-8400.pdf" 
        "How you live changes your brain" 

        For my webpage, I wanted to show how Milton Glaserâ€™s idea, "How you live changes your brain," really stands out. 
        I used a bold black-and-white look to highlight how our everyday life affects our minds.
        The big, vertical text is there to emphasize the big impact our experiences have on us. 
        Basically, I tried to make the design show just how important our daily choices and environment are.
