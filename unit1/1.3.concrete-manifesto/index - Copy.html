    <!--
    
        This is my (Rusul Abbas) interpretation of the Concrete Manifesto exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1499064/assignments/11895963
 
        This statement is from Milton Glaser https://designmanifestos.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/essays-10things-8400.pdf" 
        "How you live changes your brain" 

        For my webpage, I wanted to show how Milton Glaserâ€™s idea, "How you live changes your brain," really stands out. 
        I used a bold black-and-white look to highlight how our everyday life affects our minds.
        The big, vertical text is there to emphasize the big impact our experiences have on us. 
        Basically, I tried to make the design show just how important our daily choices and environment are.

    <style type="text/css">
        /* This class creats the style for the text */
        .text {
            display: flex; 
            align-items: center; 
            color: black;
            font-size: xx-large;
            font-family: 'Impact ', sans-serif;
            opacity: 1.0;


        }
        /*This clsass makes the text vertical*/
        .horizontal{
            writing-mode:horizontal-tb;
            text-orientation: upright;
            text-align: center;
            margin: 30px;
            font-weight: 800;
        }
