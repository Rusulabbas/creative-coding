<!-- I track my steps daily using my Apple Watch, and my goal is to hit 10,000 steps, which is tough to achieve with my busy schedule. 
Most of my steps come from going back and forth between work and classes. However, as you can see, on Fridays I tend to walk less 
because I don’t have any classes, so I’m only on campus for work. Outside of work and school, I spend most of my time in my apartment,
doing homework or studying. The main point of this project is to present my step data in a different, creative way compared 
to how it’s displayed on my Apple Watch or phone. I picked a picture of my campus as the background since that’s where I walk the most. 
Thanks! 
I used the p5.js reference to learn how to create and manage canvas elements:
https://p5js.org/reference/
I learned how to use arrays in p5.js by watching this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBqaA7zRO58
This example showed me how to draw circles and adjust their size based on numbers (like my step count):
https://p5js.org/examples/form-regular-polygon.html
I used this video to figure out how to make shapes larger when I move my mouse over them:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqEmFSlx4ps
I got the idea to store information about each circle in an array from this website after doing some research:
https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/arrays
These are the only links/tutorials I was able to retrieve. I did a significant amount of research to understand what was possible and what wasn’t. 
I didn’t follow an exact tutorial for this assignment but used my prior knowledge from personal and academic projects along with the resources above. 
I hope this is okay. I apologize for not adding all this information earlier. I’m not used to commenting on my code in my other projects, but I see 
how it's helpful for both me and my professors. I hope I’ve provided all the needed information. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to resubmit.
