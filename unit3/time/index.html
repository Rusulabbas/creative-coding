    <!--This visualization shows how energy changes throughout the day. In the morning, the circle is larger and lighter,
     representing a fresh start and higher energy. As the day goes on, it shrinks and darkens, reflecting the 
     drop in energy as we move through the evening. I wanted the shifts in color and size to capture the flow of our daily energy.
