        <!-- I took inspiration from Alison Knowles’ use of random prompts, 
         like materials, places, and inhabitants, but wanted to make it a bit more fun.
          So, I added this quirky twist where someone or something gets "kidnapped" by 
          random inhabitants, which wasn’t in the original poem. I chose materials like 
          "stone" and "ice" to build a strange house in places like "by the sea" or "in a desearted.
          "The inhabitants range from funny (like "people who sleep very little") 
          to weird ("various birds and fish"), and I threw in random characters 
           like "trump, "Dr Whalen" and " President Troy Paino" for some extra humor. 
           The whole idea was to capture Knowles’ random style but with a playful twist. -->
