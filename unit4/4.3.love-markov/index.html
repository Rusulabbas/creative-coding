 The Santa Claus Brownies by Ethel Calvert Phillips (2024) and
  A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas 
  by Charles Dickens (1843). I chose these books because they both
    have Christmas/holiday themes, but are from different periods and styles.

        MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
whatever about that. The register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he
chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my
own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about
a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors
is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands
shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You
will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.
How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were
partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole
assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and
sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully
cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent
man of business on the very day of the funeral,
and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to
the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley
was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or
nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going
to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that
Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there
would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a
stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged
gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--
literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.
There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse
door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as
Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the
business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
but he answered to both names. It was all the
same to him.

Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,
Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,
clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,
from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;
secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The
cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his
eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his
grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his
eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low
temperature always about with him; he iced his office in
the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on
Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather
chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,
no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no
pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't
know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and
snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage
over him in only one respect. They often "came down"
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with
gladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge, how are you?
When will you come to see me?" No beggars implored
him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him
what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all
his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of
Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and when they saw him coming on, would
tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and
then would wag their tails as though they said, "No
eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"

But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing
he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths
of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,
was what the knowing ones call "nuts" to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,
on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his
counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy
withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,
go wheezing up and down, beating their hands
upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the
pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had
only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--
it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring
in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like
ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog
came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was
so dense without, that although the court was of the
narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.
To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring
everything, one might have thought that Nature
lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open
that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a
dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying
letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's
fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept
the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the
clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted
that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore
the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to
warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being
a man of a strong imagination, he failed.

"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" cried
a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's
nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was
the first intimation he had of his approach.

"Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!"

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the
fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was
all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his
eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

"Christmas a humbug, uncle!" said Scrooge's
nephew. "You don't mean that, I am sure?"

"I do," said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What
right have you to be merry? What reason have you
to be merry? You're poor enough."

"Come, then," returned the nephew gaily. "What
right have you to be dismal? What reason have you
to be morose? You're rich enough."

Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur
of the moment, said, "Bah!" again; and followed it up
with "Humbug."

"Don't be cross, uncle!" said the nephew.

"What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I
live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!
Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas
time to you but a time for paying bills without
money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but
not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books
and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could
work my will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot
who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,
should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried
with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!"

"Uncle!" pleaded the nephew.

"Nephew!" returned the uncle sternly, "keep Christmas
in your own way, and let me keep it in mine."

"Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew. "But you
don't keep it."

"Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge. "Much
good may it do you! Much good it has ever done
you!"

"There are many things from which I might have
derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare
say," returned the nephew. "Christmas among the
rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas
time, when it has come round--apart from the
veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything
belonging to it can be apart from that--as a
good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar
of the year, when men and women seem by one consent
to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think
of people below them as if they really were
fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race
of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me
good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"

The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.
Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,
he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark
for ever.

"Let me hear another sound from you," said
Scrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas by losing
your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,
sir," he added, turning to his nephew. "I wonder you
don't go into Parliament."

"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow."

Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he
did. He went the whole length of the expression,
and said that he would see him in that extremity first.

"But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew. "Why?"

"Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.

"Because I fell in love."

"Because you fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if
that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous
than a merry Christmas. "Good afternoon!"

"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before
that happened. Why give it as a reason for not
coming now?"

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;
why cannot we be friends?"

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so
resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I
have been a party. But I have made the trial in
homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas
humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!"

"Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.

"And A Happy New Year!"

"Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word,
notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to
bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,
cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

"There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge; who
overheard him: "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a
week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry
Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had
let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,
pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in
their hands, and bowed to him.

"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the
gentlemen, referring to his list. "Have I the pleasure
of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"

"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,"
Scrooge replied. "He died seven years ago, this very
night."

"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented
by his surviving partner," said the gentleman, presenting
his credentials.

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred
spirits. At the ominous word "liberality," Scrooge
frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials
back.

"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,"
said the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more than
usually desirable that we should make some slight
provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer
greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in
want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands
are in want of common comforts, sir."

"Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.

"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down
the pen again.

"And the Union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge.
"Are they still in operation?"

"They are. Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish
I could say they were not."

"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,
then?" said Scrooge.

"Both very busy, sir."

"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,
that something had occurred to stop them in their
useful course," said Scrooge. "I'm very glad to
hear it."

"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,"
returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring
to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,
and means of warmth. We choose this time, because
it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down
for?"

"Nothing!" Scrooge replied.

"You wish to be anonymous?"

"I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge. "Since you
ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't
afford to make idle people merry. I help to support
the establishments I have mentioned--they cost
enough; and those who are badly off must go there."

"Many can't go there; and many would rather die."

"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had
better do it, and decrease the surplus population.
Besides--excuse me--I don't know that."

"But you might know it," observed the gentleman.

"It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's
enough for a man to understand his own business, and
not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies
me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!"

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue
their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed
his labours with an improved opinion of himself,
and in a more facetious temper than was usual
with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that
people ran about with flaring links, proffering their
services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct
them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down
at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became
invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the
clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if
its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.
The cold became intense. In the main street, at the
corner of the court, some labourers were repairing
the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were
gathered: warming their hands and winking their
eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,
and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness
of the shops where holly sprigs and berries
crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale
faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'
trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,
with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything
to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the
mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks
and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's
household should; and even the little tailor, whom he
had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for
being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up
to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean
wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting
cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped
the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather
as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then
indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The
owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled
by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with
a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of

        "God bless you, merry gentleman!
         May nothing you dismay!"

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,
that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to
the fog and even more congenial frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house
arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his
stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant
clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,
and put on his hat.

"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?" said
Scrooge.

"If quite convenient, sir."

"It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not
fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd
think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?"

The clerk smiled faintly.

"And yet," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used,
when I pay a day's wages for no work."

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every
twenty-fifth of December!" said Scrooge, buttoning
his great-coat to the chin. "But I suppose you must
have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning."

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge
walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a
twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his
white comforter dangling below his waist (for he
boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,
at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in
honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home
to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play
at blindman's-buff.

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and
beguiled the rest of the evening with his
banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in
chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a
lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so
little business to be, that one could scarcely help
fancying it must have run there when it was a young
house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,
and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough
now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but
Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.
The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew
its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.
The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of
the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all
particular about the knocker on the door, except that it
was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
London, even including--which is a bold word--the
corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be
borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate
process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow
as the other objects in the yard were, but had a
dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark
cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked
at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly
spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The
hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly
motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it
horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
face and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it
was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood
was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it
had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.
But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,
turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before
he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind
it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the
sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.
But there was nothing on the back of the door, except
the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he
said "Pooh, pooh!" and closed it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's
cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal
of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to
be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and
walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:
trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six
up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad
young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you
might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken
it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall
and the door towards the balustrades: and done it
easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room
to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge
thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before
him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of
the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,
so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with
Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.
Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before
he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms
to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection
of the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they
should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under
the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin
ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had
a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the
bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,
old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three
legs, and a poker.

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked
himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his
custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off
his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and
his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take
his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a
bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and
brood over it, before he could extract the least
sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.
The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch
merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint
Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;
Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending
through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,
Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,
hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;
and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came
like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the
whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,
with power to shape some picture on its surface from
the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would
have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.

"Humbug!" said Scrooge; and walked across the
room.

After several turns, he sat down again. As he
threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened
to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the
room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten
with a chamber in the highest story of the
building. It was with great astonishment, and with
a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he
saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in
the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it
rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.

This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,
but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had
begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking
noise, deep down below; as if some person were
dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have
heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
dragging chains.

The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,
and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors
below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight
towards his door.

"It's humbug still!" said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."

His colour changed though, when, without a pause,
it came on through the heavy door, and passed into
the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the
dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, "I know
him; Marley's Ghost!" and fell again.

The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,
usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on
the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,
and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was
clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound
about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge
observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,
ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.
His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,
and looking through his waistcoat, could see
the two buttons on his coat behind.

Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no
bowels, but he had never believed it until now.

No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he
looked the phantom through and through, and saw
it standing before him; though he felt the chilling
influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very
texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head
and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;
he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.

"How now!" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
"What do you want with me?"

"Much!"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.

"Who are you?"

"Ask me who I was."

"Who were you then?" said Scrooge, raising his
voice. "You're particular, for a shade." He was going
to say "to a shade," but substituted this, as more
appropriate.

"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley."

"Can you--can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking
doubtfully at him.

"I can."

"Do it, then."

Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide
after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,
and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was
acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his
own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could
not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in
eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them
from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh
daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.

So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely
home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his
wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him
into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there
came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;
even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were
not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him
except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not
let him get home.

Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the worlds end,
and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.1 He had
gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying
himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of
Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment
he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnons son
Orestes; so he said to the other gods:

“See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing
but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to
Agamemnons wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew
it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do
either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his
revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him
this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for
everything in full.”

Then Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served
Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but
Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart
bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,
far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with
forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,
daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the
ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth
asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,
and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his
home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may
once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of
this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you
with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry
with him?”

And Jove said, “My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget
Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more
liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear
in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having
blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to
Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys;
therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by
preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together
and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified,
for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.”

And Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the
gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send
Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our
minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to
put heart into Ulysses son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the
Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother
Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I
will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear
anything about the return of his dear father—for this will make people
speak well of him.”

So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,
with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the
redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong,
wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and
down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith
she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses house, disguised as a
visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in
her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the
oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of
the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon
them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning
down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some
cutting up great quantities of meat.

Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily
among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would
send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again
and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them,
he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was
vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took
her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. “Welcome,”
said he, “to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall
tell us what you have come for.”

He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were
within he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong
bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father,
and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a
cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,2 and he set
another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she
might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and
that he might ask her more freely about his father.

A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and
poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she
drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread,
and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the
carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold
by their side, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for
them.


Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and
seats.3 Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids
went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with
wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that
were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they
wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a
banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled
perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to
sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that
no man might hear.

“I hope, sir,” said he, “that you will not be offended with what I am
going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and
all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some
wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see
my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather
than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has
fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is
coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,
sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from.
Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how
your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared
themselves to be—for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly,
for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been
here in my fathers time? In the old days we had many visitors for my
father went about much himself.”

And Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about
it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I
have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign
tongue being bound for Temesa4 with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring
back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country
away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron5 under the wooded mountain
Neritum.6 Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell
you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes
to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with
an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when he
comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your
father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the
gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the
mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean,
or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I
am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is
borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away
much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were
in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But
tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking
fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head
and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where
the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never
either of us seen the other.”

“My mother,” answered Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it
is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one
who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is
no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my
father.”

And Minerva said, “There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while
Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,
what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?
What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in
the family—for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own?
And the guests—how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make
over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person
who comes near them.”

“Sir,” said Telemachus, “as regards your question, so long as my father
was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their
displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more
closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it
better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before
Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting
were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his
ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the
storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone
without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing
but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of
my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the
chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island
of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are
eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my
mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry,7 nor
yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and
before long will do so also with myself.”

“Is that so?” exclaimed Minerva, “then you do indeed want Ulysses home
again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he
is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and
making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,
were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming
from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus,
son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give
him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him.
If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short
shrift and a sorry wedding.

“But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,
and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you
to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my
advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your
case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors
take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mothers mind
is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find
her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear
a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take
the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest
of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you
something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some
heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;
thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all
the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way
home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet
another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come
home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a
barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having
done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or
foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to
plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing
Orestes praises for having killed his fathers murderer Aegisthus? You
are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make
yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and
to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think
the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.”

“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me
in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell
me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a
little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will
then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will
give you one of great beauty and value—a keepsake such as only dear
friends give to one another.”

Minerva answered, “Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at
once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I
come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very
good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.”

With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had
given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about
his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the
stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were
sitting.

Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he
told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had
laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song
from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not
alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the
suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof
of the cloisters8 with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a
veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.

“Phemius,” she cried, “you know many another feat of gods and heroes,
such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,
and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for
it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I
mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas
and middle Argos.”9

“Mother,” answered Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind
to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who
makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own
good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated
return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most
warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only
man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well
as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily
duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for
speech is mans matter, and mine above all others 10—for it is I who am
master here.”

She went wondering back into the house, and laid her sons saying in
her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she
mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.
But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters11, and
prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.

Then Telemachus spoke, “Shameless,” he cried, “and insolent suitors,
let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it
is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;
but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal
notice to depart, and feast at one anothers houses, turn and turn
about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in
spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you
in full, and when you fall in my fathers house there shall be no man
to avenge you.”

The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the
boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, “The
gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may
Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before
you.”

Telemachus answered, “Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,
I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of
for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and
honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in
Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;
nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom
Ulysses has won for me.”

Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, “It rests with heaven to
decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own
house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in
Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I
want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of
what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news
about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He
seemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was
gone in a moment before we could get to know him.”

“My father is dead and gone,” answered Telemachus, “and even if some
rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed
sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his
prophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of
Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my fathers.” But in
his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.

The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the
evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to
bed each in his own abode.12 Telemachuss room was high up in a tower13
that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and
full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son
of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes
had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the
worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his
household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to
his bed for he feared his wifes resentment.14 She it was who now
lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of
the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a
baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as
he took off his shirt15 he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it
tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which
she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt
home by means of the strap.16 But Telemachus as he lay covered with a
woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage
and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.

It was a bright cold March morning and round the four corners of Santa
Clauss Snow Palace on the very tip-top of the North Pole the wind
swept blustering and shouting on his way.

It was so early in the morning that some of Santa Clauss Brownies had
not yet finished their household tasks.

Little Crusty, oldest of the Brownies, who was in charge of the
reindeer and who, in spite of a snarled-up face, had a very tender
heart, was still busy in the stable, brushing the brown coats of the
eight tiny reindeer and making them glossy and neat for the day.

Down in the kitchen Sweet-Tooth, chief of the candy cooks, was showing
his tidy little band of helpers, each in white apron and cap, how to
make very-black licorice drops.

Now that March is here some Brownie is sure to catch a Spring cold,
said Sweet-Tooth, measuring and mixing with all his might, and there
is nothing better than licorice drops for a cold in the Spring.

Out in front of the Palace stood Nimbletoes, sweeping off the steps
with great strokes of his broom. Nimbletoes, who could run as fast and
jump as high as any Brownie who ever lived, was late with his work this
morning because he had been running and playing in the wind.

I could run for miles and miles this morning, said Nimbletoes with a
last little jump, but I suppose I must finish my work. Here goes!

And Nimbletoes made his arms fly round like the sails of a windmill as
he swept the steps with great wide flourishes of his broom.

All the other Brownies were hard at work in Santa Clauss work-room,
making Christmas toys. Although December and Christmas seemed far away,
when you stop to think how many toys Santa Claus must have ready on
Christmas Eve, you will see why the Brownies were kept busy the whole
year long.

Kindheart was fitting a blue flannel jacket on a tiny baby doll.
Silvertongue was finishing off a great white furry rabbit, with
gleaming ruby-red eyes and the cunningest little bob-tail in the world.
Mischief was painting a gay yellow sled. Fleetfoot was whittling the
sticks of a drum. Santa Claus was fitting out a little boys tool box,
and very great pains he took with it, too.

Over in a corner sat Merrythought, the very best toy-maker of them all,
and beside him stood Sharpeyes, the little errand boy, who picked up
pins and threaded needles and found lost scissors for all the other
Brownies. But for the past week, as a special treat, Sharpeyes had been
working upon a toy, too. Merrythought had showed him how to make a
Rocking-Horse, and now the gay little prancing steed stood before them
finished, except for a leather bridle that Sharpeyes was trying to fit
into the Ponys mouth.

He was a little brown Pony with a long brown tail and a wavy brown
mane. His mouth was a bright, bright red. He wore a yellow saddle
fastened by neat little straps. And in his head there sparkled two dark
brown eyes, quite the prettiest brown eyes, Sharpeyes thought, that a
little Pony had ever worn.

But, in spite of this, there was something about those pretty brown
eyes that did not please the Rocking-Horse Pony. And this is the way he
showed his feeling about it.

The first thing that morning, when Merrythought and Sharpeyes went to
work on the Rocking-Horse Pony, Sharpeyes said, I think I will give
my Pony brown eyes, Merrythought, because they will match his brown
coat so well.

So into the little Ponys head went the dark brown eyes.

This was the first time the Pony had been able to see, you know, and
Sharpeyes and Merrythought both laughed to watch him stare in pleasure
and astonishment round the work-room, already fairly well filled with
toys.

The little Rocking-Horse Pony looked at Santa Claus, he looked at the
Brownies, he looked at the toys. Then slowly and taking plenty of time
the Rocking-Horse Pony began to rock himself all around the room.

He stopped before the woolly lambs and stared earnestly into their mild
brown eyes. He rocked round to the furry rabbits and gazed at their
eyes of ruby-red. He studied the pussy-cats and the toy dogs, the
tigers and the elephants, the Teddy bears with their eyes of yellow and
brown and black. But when he reached the corner where Kindheart was at
work upon his baby dolls, each one with eyes of beautiful bright blue,
then the Rocking-Horse Pony stood still before them and quite refused
to move.

He shook himself impatiently when Sharpeyes called him to come. He
did not turn his head when Merrythought snapped his fingers and said,
Here, Pony! Here, sir, come!

He not only stood still before the dolls, but he looked and he looked
at their lovely blue eyes. And the next moment, with a wink and a
blink, the Ponys own brown eyes flew out of his head and landed upon
the floor!

Good gracious! exclaimed Merrythought. Put them in again, Sharpeyes,
as fast as you can.

Into the little Ponys head went the dark brown eyes again. But--would
you believe it?--in less than no time the brown eyes lay upon the floor
once more, and the ponys red mouth wore a satisfied smile that seemed
to say, Now see! Ive done it again.

I dont like this, said Merrythought, shaking his head. I never knew
eyes to fall out of a Ponys head before.

Perhaps I dont put them in the right way, answered Sharpeyes,
looking troubled. This is the first toy I have ever made. Watch me,
Merrythought, and see that I do it well.

Merrythought and Sharpeyes both worked away until it seemed as if the
brown eyes would never come out again.

But in less than ten minutes not only were the eyes out of the Ponys
head, but they were lost as well. Sharpeyes searched for almost half an
hour before he found them. And where do you think they were? You would
never, never guess. One of them was tucked in the corner of a doll
carriage under a pink-and-white wool cover. That was strange enough.
But the other eye was stuffed into the wide-open red mouth of a poor
little trumpeting elephant, who was so surprised that his thin gray
tail stood straight out with excitement and fright. This was stranger
and stranger still. It almost seemed as if the Pony had hidden them
on purpose himself, though no one could imagine how he had done such
a thing. A lively little toy monkey, who had been watching the Pony,
might have told something about it, if he had wished. But he didnt
speak a word.

What ails my Pony, Merrythought? asked Sharpeyes. I never knew toys
acted in this way. Do you think perhaps he doesnt like his brown
eyes?

Why wouldnt he like his brown eyes? replied Merrythought. He is
simply full of fun and likes a joke. But we must put those eyes in to
stay. Let us go and look for some of Mr. Mendhams glue. He may have
left a little when he was here a year or so ago. There is no glue in
the world like Mr. Mendhams.

Mr. Mendham is a very fine Toy Tinker, isnt he? asked Sharpeyes. I
believe he could mend any broken toy. Do you remember the Christmas
time he and Mrs. Mendham came here to help Santa Claus make the toys?

Of course I do, answered Merrythought, smiling at the question. He
came to help because we Brownies were all ill in bed from eating too
many of Sweet-Tooths rich caramel creams.

Does he live far from here? asked Sharpeyes. I have never seen his
house.

Not so far, was Merrythoughts reply. Straight down past the Eskimo
village and then on to a little wood of evergreen trees. His house
stands there with a sign over the door. Now let us try to find a bit of
Mr. Mendhams glue.

Neither Sharpeyes nor Merrythought glanced at the Pony. If they had
they would have seen in a moment that he had listened to every word
they said.

At the words Toy Tinker the Ponys tail had begun to swish. When
Merrythought had told where Mr. Mendham lived, the Ponys ears had
twitched to and fro. And no sooner did the Pony have a moment to
himself than over to the window he rocked and tried to push it open
with his little red nose. How he knew his way about without any eyes I
dont know. And once he had opened the window, did he mean to jump out?

Nobody can tell. For Brownie Kindheart felt the cold air on his doll
babies and closed the window. And just then back came Merrythought and
Sharpeyes with a pot of Mr. Mendhams glue. Neatly and firmly the brown
eyes were glued in, this time to stay, though the naughty little Pony
rocked and pranced to show that he did not like it at all.

But Sharpeyes was pleased.

He is a beautiful Pony, said Sharpeyes with pride. I will put on his
bridle now and then he will be finished.

But the Rocking-Horse Pony did not want to wear his bridle. He shut his
mouth tight and tossed his head. He rocked himself to and fro with a
thump and a bump. It was plain to be seen that the Rocking-Horse Pony
did not wish to wear a bridle. And with a sudden toss and jerk of his
head he managed to break the bridle quite in two.

Oh! exclaimed Sharpeyes, unexpectedly tumbling backward and sitting
down hard upon the floor. Oh! What shall we do?

[Illustration]

Fetch a new bridle out of the store-room, answered Merrythought,
helping his friend to his feet. Come along and I will show you where
they are.

Now every one in the work-room was as busy as could be. No one saw
that Sharpeyes and Merrythought had left the room. Much less did they
notice the Rocking-Horse Pony, who now rocked quietly over to the door,
moved out into the hall, and started down the stairs with a thump!
thump! thump! Just as softly as he could manage, you may be sure.

The first one to spy the Rocking-Horse Pony was Nimbletoes, still busy
at sweeping the Palace front steps.

Down the steps behind Nimbletoes back bumped the Pony, and then off
he started over the snow at a rocking, galloping canter that surprised
even himself, it carried him over the ground at such a pace.

In the mean time Nimbletoes stood staring. He couldnt believe his
eyes. For a whole half-minute he stood there, leaning on his broom, his
eyes and his mouth open wide.

Then Nimbletoes gave a great leap into the air.

Hi, there! he shouted up at the work-room windows. Hi, there!
Sharpeyes! Merrythought! Your Pony has run away! Brownies! Brownies!
Come! Come!

At this loud shouting all the Brownies, and Santa Claus, too, rushed
to the work-room windows and looked out. Up from the kitchen scampered
Sweet-Tooth, leaving the very-black licorice drops to his band of
little cooks. Out of the stable hurried little Crusty, his scarlet cap
tipped over one ear and the reindeers hair-brush clutched in his hand.

They all saw a strange sight--the Rocking-Horse Pony rocking swiftly
away over the snow and after him Brownie Nimbletoes, using his broom as
a staff, taking great flying leaps and bounds, the wind lifting him off
his feet time and time again.

My Pony! My Pony! called Sharpeyes, running toward the door. Oh,
Merrythought! Oh, Brownies! Help me, do!

At this, all the Brownies trooped after him, down the stairs, out the
front door, and over the snow, while Santa Claus stood on the steps,
laughing and waving them on.

Catch him, Brownies! Catch him! called Santa Claus. Oh, what a race!

A race it was! For the Rocking-Horse Pony seemed fairly to skim over
the ground, and behind him, blown by the wind and carried by their own
swift little feet, came the Brownies, every one, for Sweet-Tooth and
Crusty had joined them and were running quite as fast as any one else.

The Rocking-Horse Pony seemed to know where he wanted to go. On and
on he rocked over the ice and snow. Now he came to a group of low
round huts made of snow, where the Eskimos lived, fathers and mothers
and little boy and girl Eskimos, too. Smoke was pouring from the hole
in the top of each hut, and this smoke the wind caught and gayly blew
hither and yon. The little Eskimo boys and girls, bundled in fur, ran
out of the huts, their long-haired dogs barking at their heels, and
they all, children and dogs, stared in amazement at the galloping
Rocking-Horse Pony who was followed so closely by the gay band of
Brownies, laughing and shouting and waving their arms as they sped by.

Now came the evergreen trees, tall and thick and green, and the
Rocking-Horse Pony and the Brownies found themselves racing through a
dense little wood.

I know where he is going! shouted Nimbletoes, who, with Brownie
Fleetfoot, was running well in the lead. I believe he is going to Mr.
Mendhams house!
The news was passed down the line until the last one in the procession,
little old Crusty, heard the tidings.

He is going to Mr. Mendhams, we all believe!

Soon the Brownies set up another shout.

There is Mr. Mendhams house! We are right! Sharpeyes Pony is going
to Mr. Mendhams house.

Between two tall trees before them there stood a little house, a
little white house with a bright red chimney, green window-boxes, and a
green front door. Over the door hung a sign--

  MR. MENDHAM
  TOY TINKER
  The Brownies saw the Rocking-Horse Pony take the knocker on the green
  front door in his mouth and rap smartly--Rap-a-tap-tap! There was no
  answer, so the Rocking-Horse Pony gently pushed the door open and
  rocked inside. The door shut behind him with a thump.
  
  Now out behind the house, busily hanging up a basketful of clothes,
  were Mr. and Mrs. Mendham. They spied the Brownies, they came running
  forward, and when they heard about the Rocking-Horse Pony they crept
  into the house on tiptoe, followed by the Brownies, to see what the
  Pony was doing now.
  
  There he was in Mr. Mendhams work-room, rocking round and round,
  looking for something with all his might and main. He looked high, he
  looked low, he even looked in the corners and on the floor. But at last
  he gave up the search and stood still in the middle of the room, and
  the Brownies and Mr. and Mrs. Mendham saw that the tears were rolling
  down his little brown face. He looked as if his heart was broken. What
  was the matter with the Rocking-Horse Pony?
  
  The mended toys in the work-room were trying to help the little brown
  Pony.
  
  I know Mr. Mendham keeps his eyes in that basket over there, said a
  black-and-white dog with a bright red tongue, but, as you can see, he
  hasnt a blue eye left, not one.
  
  He put his last blue eyes in my head, said a big white furry kitten,
  who had a golden bell tied about his neck. For my part I dont like
  blue eyes. I prefer green. They shine so well in the dark. If Mr.
  Mendham will give me green eyes, you may have my blue.
  
  At this kind offer all the toys began to call out, Mr. Mendham! Mr.
  Mendham!
  
  So Mr. Mendham and the Brownies trooped into the room.
  
  Why didnt you tell me you wanted blue eyes? asked Sharpeyes as he
  wiped the tears from his little Ponys face. Of course you shall have
  them if Mr. Mendham is willing to make the change.
  
  Certainly, certainly, agreed Mr. Mendham, who was a kind-hearted man.
  Green eyes always look well in a cat, and there is no reason why this
  Pony shouldnt have blue eyes, though I will say I never gave them to a
  Rocking-Horse before.
  
  Blue eyes are so beautiful, murmured the Rocking-Horse Pony. I
  couldnt bear to think of starting out next Christmas Eve with brown
  eyes in my head.
  
  So Mr. Mendham made the change in a twinkling.
  
  The white cat was more than satisfied with his new green eyes.
  
  They have a fine sparkle and gleam, he purred, with a proud wave of
  his tail. Blue eyes are too girlish for me.
  
  And the Rocking-Horse Pony was happier than words can tell. He smiled,
  he rocked, he bumped about in a very ecstasy of joy. When the time
  came, he rocked home, with Sharpeyes on his back, in a very whirl of
  pleasure.
  
  Blue eyes! Blue eyes! he sang to himself as he bumped over the snow.
  
  When Sharpeyes showed the Pony to Santa Claus and told him what had
  happened, Santa Claus laughed and rubbed the Rocking-Horse Pony upon
  his soft brown nose.
  
  I know a little boy who likes blue eyes the very best of all, said
  Santa Claus, and you shall go to live with him next Christmas, if you
  wish.
  
  When he heard this, the Rocking-Horse Pony was so happy he thought his
  heart would burst with joy.
  
  So if, next Christmas, you meet a little boy who has a Rocking-Horse
  Pony with bright blue eyes, you may know that the Pony was made by
  Brownie Sharpeyes and that he came down on Christmas Eve in Santa
  Clauss sleigh straight from the Snow Palace on the very tip-top of the
  North Pole.
  
  
  
  
  THE GAY LITTLE TOWN OF BO-PEEP
  
  
  
  
  THE GAY LITTLE TOWN OF BO-PEEP
  
  
  Santa Claus stood on the front steps of his Snow Palace at the very
  tip-top of the North Pole.
  
  Softly, very softly, the great door behind him swung open and out
  rushed the Brownies, pulling on their scarlet caps, fastening their
  mittens, and laughing and shouting and calling as they came.
  
  Santa Claus! Santa Claus! shouted the Brownies. Here we come, Santa
  Claus! Here we all come!
  
  What does this mean? asked Santa Claus in surprise, his eyes
  twinkling with fun. Why arent you hard at work upstairs, making toys?
  Come, come, now!
  
  And Santa Claus laughed in spite of himself to see his Brownies turning
  somersaults in the soft snow.
  
  Oh, Santa Claus, we want a holiday! shouted the Brownies. We dont
  feel like working at all. We want a holiday, Santa Claus. Do say that
  we may.
  
  Yes, yes, indeed, nodded Santa Claus, laughing again to see his
  Brownies antics in the snow. You will work all the better for a
  little fun. Be off, every one.
  
  So off they went, three by three, each little group of Brownies with a
  plan of its own.
  
  Sharpeyes, the little errand boy, Merrythought, the very best toy-maker
  of them all, and little Crusty, who was in charge of the reindeer, ran
  off to call on a nearby family of seals.
  
  Mischief, Nimbletoes, and Fleetfoot scampered down to a great smooth
  stretch of snow back of the stable where the eight tiny reindeer lived.
  
  We want to run races, Santa Claus, called they, more than anything
  else in the world.
  
  Kindheart, Silvertongue, and Sweet-Tooth, chief of the candy cooks,
  stood for a moment wondering just where they would go.
  
  We mean to take a long walk, said Silvertongue to Santa Claus, who
  stood by their side. Tell us where to go, Santa Claus, for we dont
  know.
  
  Have you ever been to the Town of Bo-Peep? asked Santa Claus. I
  would go there, if I were you. It used to be a gay, merry little Town,
  but you will find it very different now. Stay as long as you like.
  There may be some work for you to do.
  
  So the three Brownies set off for the Town of Bo-Peep.
  
  It is too far to walk all the way, said Santa Claus. You had better
  borrow my handkerchief for a sail.
  
  A gentle breeze was blowing, and as the Brownies held up Santa Clauss
  great white handkerchief, with S.C. embroidered in the corner, the wind
  filled the handkerchief like a sail and took them steadily along.
  
  It was great fun to skim over the ground and surprising to see how
  quickly they traveled. They soon left the cold and snow behind.
  Presently the grass grew green and the sun shone warm and the three
  little Brownies put down the great handkerchief and tripped merrily
  along the road hand in hand.
  
  I smell the sea, said Sweet-Tooth, who, being a cook, had a very
  sharp nose.
  
  On they ran, and at a turn in the road they came upon the sea, wide and
  blue and sparkling under a summer sky. Far out in the water stood a
  Lighthouse. Below the road stretched the beach, a long curve of firm,
  white sand, and back of the beach lay the little Town of Bo-Peep.
  
  It was a pretty little Town with red roofs and chimney pots, and each
  little house had its own gay little garden plot.
  
  But the Town was quiet, no one walked about the streets. And though the
  tide was low and the cool wet sand lay bare, not a single child was
  playing on the beach.
  
  They have all gone away, said Kindheart. The Town seems empty
  to-day.
  
  Perhaps they have gone on a picnic, suggested Silvertongue, or for a
  sail across the bay.
  
  But Sweet-Tooth shook his head.
  
  The mothers are at home, said he. I can see the smoke rising from
  the chimneys and I think I can smell baking bread.
  
  Let us go down into the town, said Kindheart, and look about. Santa
  Claus said there might be work to do.
  
  Down in the town the three little Brownies walked quietly along, past
  the neat houses, past the gay flower-beds, until they came to a little
  shop, and here the Brownies stood stock still on the sandy road.
  
  It was a Candy Shop. At least a big sign over the door said so. But the
  blinds were pulled down and the door was shut tight and there was a
  card in the window that read
  
    NO CANDY SOLD HERE
  
  The Brownies looked at one another. Sweet-Tooths face wore a horrified
  look. He couldnt speak. He managed to peep under the window-shade, but
  all the window held was a dismal row of empty glass candy jars.
  
  It must be there are no children in the Town, said Silvertongue in a
  low voice.
  
  And Kindheart and Sweet-Tooth could only nod their heads in reply.
  
  A few steps beyond the Candy Shop they came upon another little store.
  TOY SHOP was painted on the window. But here too the blinds were down
  and the door locked fast and thick dust covered the doorstep and the
  window-ledge. Kindheart stood on tiptoe and read a card tacked on the
  door.
  
    NO TOYS SOLD HERE
  
  What can be the matter? whispered the Brownies. Who ever heard
  before of a Town where no children lived?
  
  Down on the beach crept the Brownies and here strange signs were
  sprinkled as thick as blackberries wherever they might look.
  
    NO PADDLING ON THIS BEACH
  
  said a bright blue sign stuck in the sand here and there.
  
  The Brownies read this aloud and tears came into gentle Kindhearts
  eyes.
  
  I never saw a better beach for paddling, said he, wiping away his
  tears with the back of his hand.
  
  Listen to this! cried Silvertongue, standing before a scarlet sign
  that was repeated all along the shore.
  
    NO SAND BUILDING ALLOWED
  
  read the scarlet sign in great black letters that all could see.
  
  What about this? called Sweet-Tooth, capering before a green sign
  over which he had just stubbed his toe.
  
    NO DIGGING ON THIS BEACH
  
  That is what the sign says. But I cant believe it. I am going
  straight through this Town until I see what they have done with the
  children here.
  
  The Brownies did not have far to go to find the children. A stones
  throw from the beach stood the school-house, a dingy red brick building
  with a tall iron fence all roundabout.
  
  Under the fence squeezed the Brownies. They wanted to read a great
  golden sign over the school-house door.
  
    THIS SCHOOL OPEN FROM
    NINE UNTIL SIX OCLOCK
  
  Sweet-Tooth read the sign aloud and would have tumbled to the ground in
  his surprise if Silvertongue and Kindheart had not caught him by the
  arm.
  
  That means all day! gasped Sweet-Tooth. They have to go to school
  all day!
  
  Through the school-house window they could see the heads of the
  children, little brown and yellow and black heads, both curly and
  straight. Indeed one little red head lay on the window-sill, fast
  asleep.
  
  Tired out, and no wonder, murmured Silvertongue, which was a very
  harsh speech for him.
  
  Out of the window floated the voices of the children droning sleepily
  over and over again--
  
    Two times one are two,
     Two times two are four,
     Two times three are six.
  
  The Brownies didnt speak another word that afternoon. They sat down
  round the corner of the school-house with their backs against the wall
  and watched the clock in the church tower tick the sunny hours away.
  
  At last the clock struck six.
  
  Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
  
  The school-house door opened and out trooped the children. As they
  started home, the Brownies followed and watched them as they went.
  
  Some of them peeped in the Toy Shop window and rattled the latch. Some
  of them stood on tiptoe and knocked the knocker on the Candy Shop door.
  Some of them ran away from their big brothers and sisters and sat on
  the beach and made holes in the sand with their fingers and piled up
  little heaps. And some of the children even ran down and put their toes
  in the water, they did so want a little pleasure and fun.
  
  But their big brothers and sisters were frightened.
  
  The King will see you! said they. Come home! The King will catch
  you!
  
  So the Children were taken home, and soon after their supper the
  candles were lighted in their bedrooms and the Brownies could see the
  children in their night-gowns going to bed.
  
  As it grew dusk, the Brownies sat flat on the lonely beach with no one
  but the sandpipers and the seagulls to keep them company.
  
  What did it all mean? Who was the King? Why were the children treated
  so?
  
  The light in the Lighthouse across the bay blazed out and Kindheart
  sprang to his feet.
  
  I am going to borrow that little boat, said he, pointing to a white
  boat pulled up on the beach, and row over to the Lighthouse. Perhaps
  some one there can tell us what it is all about.
  
  When they reached the Lighthouse two figures ran down to the shore and
  helped them from the boat.
  
  One was that of a little man who smelled strongly of peppermint candy.
  
  He is the Candy Man, said Sweet-Tooth in a flash. And so he proved to
  be.
  
  The other figure was that of a neat little lady who held a half-made
  dolls dress in her hand.
  
  The Toy Lady, said Silvertongue and Kindheart in a breath. And this
  was so too.
  
  The Candy Man and the Toy Lady both talked at once, they were so
  excited at seeing the Brownies and so anxious to tell their tale.
  
  It is the new Kings fault, said they, together. He wont have a bit
  of noise. He doesnt want the children to romp and be noisy, and that
  is why they must go to school all day and never play on the beach. That
  is why he sent us over here to live. He doesnt want the children to
  eat candy nor to play with toys. All the King does from morning till
  night is to think of different things we mustnt do and then make
  signs to tell us so. Bo-Peep Town used to be a gay and merry place to
  live in, but now we are miserable, just miserable. And the children
  simply long to have us come back again.
  
  The Brownies and the Toy Lady and the Candy Man sat up almost all night
  talking things over. Of course matters couldnt go on as they were. And
  once they had made up their minds what to do, they fell to work.
  
  For two days and nights they worked as hard as ever they could. The
  Candy Man and Sweet-Tooth made candy, all kinds. Silvertongue and
  Kindheart and the Toy Lady made toys--boats and pails and shovels and
  all sorts of sand toys, fish and stars and patty-pans and cones.
  
  Then early one morning, when it was darkest, just before dawn, they
  filled their little boat with toys and candy and rowed over to the
  mainland.
  
  The Brownies first helped the Toy Lady and the Candy Man to open their
  little shops and place the toys and candy inside.
  
  Then Silvertongue and Kindheart and Sweet-Tooth stole into the Palace
  and up to the bedroom where the King and his little Queen lay sleeping
  side by side.
  
  They were thoughtful little Brownies, you must admit. They packed a bag
  of clothes for the King and Queen. They even remembered their golden
  crowns and put them in too.
  
  Then they carried the sleeping King and Queen down to the little boat,
  rowed them over to the Lighthouse, and left them there.
  
  Next morning when the children went to school there was a new sign on
  the door.
  
    NO SCHOOL TO-DAY
  
  Some one spied the Toy Shop. The door was wide open. The window was
  filled with brand-new toys, and a fresh sign was fluttering in the
  breeze.
  
    PENNY TOYS SOLD HERE
  
  At first the children crowded round and stared. Then they sped to the
  Candy Shop. That was wide open, too, every glass jar filled to the brim
  with the most delicious candy ever seen.
  
  The sign! The sign! shrieked the children.
  
  There it was, shining and new.
  
    PENNY CANDY SOLD HERE
  
  Down to the beach ran the children, screaming as they ran. They were so
  excited they had forgotten the King.
  
  The beach was covered with glittering new signs.
  
    PLEASE PADDLE ON THE
    BEACH
  
    GOOD SAND FOR BUILDING
    HERE
  
    KINDLY DIG ON THIS BEACH
  
  The children scarcely knew what to do first. Some ran to the Toy Shop,
  others to the Candy Man to taste his fine new wares. How glad they were
  to see their old friends, the Toy Lady and the Candy Man, once more!
  Some of the children settled down to dig, some of them fell to building
  in the sand, while many of them pulled off their shoes and stockings
  and happily splashed and paddled about in the cool green waves.
  
  Every one took a holiday, fathers and mothers too. And that night, when
  dusk fell, they were still romping and playing and enjoying themselves
  on the beach.
  
  Suddenly, out blazed the light from the Lighthouse and the figures of
  the King and the Queen stood on the shore.
  
  We like it here! shouted the King, making a great deal of noise for
  such a quiet man. We mean to stay! It is quiet here! We never want to
  live in the Town again!
  
  The King and the Queen waved their hands good-bye. They had reached the
  Lighthouse door when the King turned back.
  
  Our crowns! he shouted. You may have them! We dont want them any
  more!
  
  And he tossed them one by one into the sea.
  
  When the crowns came floating in on the beach, the people picked them
  up and gave them to the Toy Lady and the Candy Man.
  
  Please be our King and Queen, said they.
  
  But the Toy Lady and the Candy Man shook their heads.
  
  I would rather sell toys than be a Queen, said the Toy Lady.
  
  I would rather make candy than be a King, said the Candy Man.
  
  So, since they had no King nor Queen, the people locked the front door
  of the Palace and threw the key away. The crowns they fastened over the
  Toy Shop and the Candy Shop because they looked well hanging there.
  
  Bo-Peep Town became overnight what it had always been before, a gay and
  lively and pleasant place in which to live.
  
  And Silvertongue and Kindheart and Sweet-Tooth went home happy, but not
  any more happy than Santa Claus when he heard what they had done.
  
  
  
  
  BUTTONS AND BOOTS
  
  
  
  
  BUTTONS AND BOOTS
  
  
  It was the middle of the night. All the Brownies, and Santa Claus, too,
  were fast asleep in their beds in the Snow Palace at the very tip-top
  of the North Pole.
  
  It was a cold, frosty night. Whoo-oo-oo! Whoo-oo-oo! sang the West
  Wind round the chimneys, in such a chilly voice, with a tinkle of ice
  in it, that the Brownies snuggled down under their covers and pulled
  the bed-quilts up about their ears.
  
  All the Brownies were fast asleep, I said. But, as the great clock
  in the hall downstairs slowly boomed out the hour of twelve, Brownie
  Fleetfoot opened his bright black eyes.
  
  Ugh! How cold it is! shivered Brownie Fleetfoot, trying to roll
  himself into a ball. It wasnt so cold when I went to bed. I wonder
  what the Moon is laughing at up there in the sky. He likes to see me
  freeze, I guess.
  
  For a great silver Moon, with a broad smile on his face, was looking
  straight in the window at Fleetfoot, and it did seem as if he were
  laughing at some joke of his own.
  
  I will shut my eyes and count ten, said Fleetfoot to himself, and
  then I will look at the Moon again to see if he is still laughing at
  me.
  
  He shut his black eyes with a snap. Slowly he counted up to ten. But
  when he opened his eyes again he forgot the Moon entirely.
  
  For beside his bed stood a little figure dressed in snowy white.
  He wore a glittering cap trimmed with a frosty plume, and over his
  shoulder, like a soldiers musket, he carried a paint-brush, long and
  slim.
  
  Jack Frost! exclaimed Fleetfoot, sitting up in surprise. Jack Frost!
  What are you doing here? No wonder I was so cold with you standing
  beside my bed. That was why the Moon laughed in at me, I suppose. He
  saw you all the while.
  
  Yes, he did, nodded Jack Frost, unbuttoning his snowy white coat.
  How warm it is in here! He watched me slip through the crack in the
  window. It made him laugh, too, because I have been tickling you with
  an icicle trying to wake you up. Put on your clothes, Fleetfoot, and
  come along with me. I have a piece of work for you to do.
  
  Jack Frost and Santa Claus and the Brownies were old, old friends. Jack
  Frost was always glad to do Santa Claus a good turn, such as making
  Christmas Day bright and cold, with plenty of snow and ice for the boys
  and girls with new snow-shoes and sleds and skates. On the other hand,
  as every one knows, all Brownies, and of course Santa Clauss Brownies,
  too, are never so happy as when they are being helpful and kind. These
  Brownies at the North Pole were quite used to being called upon, day or
  night, to do some kind or thoughtful act.
  
  Fleetfoot was not surprised, therefore, when he heard that Jack Frost
  had a piece of work for him to do. He dressed in a twinkling. It took
  him only a moment to slip into his neat little suit, draw on his
  pointed Brownie shoes, and pull his scarlet Brownie cap well down over
  his ears.
  
  I am ready, he whispered, creeping over to the door.
  
  But Jack Frost laid a chilly little hand on his arm.
  
  Bring a bell with you, murmured Jack Frost in the Brownies ear. You
  will need to use a bell to-night.
  
  A bell? whispered back Fleetfoot. What kind of bell? A dinner bell?
  A bicycle bell?
  
  No, answered Jack Frost, his finger on his lips, a cats bell. Hush!
  
  For Brownie Mischief had flung out his arms and tossed his quilt off on
  the floor, and Sharpeyes had turned over with a long, long sigh.
  
  Fleetfoot crept on tiptoe into the work-room and without a sound untied
  a silver bell from the neck of a drowsy white fur cat.
  
  Then he and Jack Frost stole downstairs and out of the house without
  being seen by a single person except the friendly Moon, who not only
  smiled as he watched them, but followed them on their journey all the
  way.
  
  Now, we can talk, said Jack Frost, as hand in hand they sped over the
  snow. Let me tell you why I came after you to-night.
  
  Brownie Fleetfoot nodded his red-capped head. This was just what he
  wanted to know, of course.
  
  In the first place, began Jack Frost, Buttons has lost Boots.
  
  Here he paused for a moment to shift his paint-brush from one shoulder
  to the other, but Fleetfoot was too wise to interrupt by a question. He
  knew what a sharp little fellow Jack Frost could be if he wished.
  
  Buttons is a little boy, went on Jack Frost, taking a tight hold on
  Fleetfoots hand. He has a new winter coat trimmed with brass buttons.
  And, too, his eyes are as round as buttons and so are his nose and his
  mouth. All this may be why he is called Buttons. I cant say. Boots
  is his cat. It is easy to tell where he gets his name, for he wears a
  white fur boot on each foot.
  
  Brownie Fleetfoot didnt answer, for at that moment he tumbled
  headlong into a drift of snow. He lay there kicking until Jack Frost
  pulled him out and gently shook him to brush him off.
  
  Try to keep your eyes open, said Jack Frost, tweaking the end of
  Fleetfoots nose. And now come along. I was in Buttons front yard
  to-night painting his maple tree yellow and red, continued Jack Frost,
  and a very pretty tree it is going to be. The night was as quiet as
  quiet could be, not a sound, when, all of a sudden, out of the door
  like a flash came Boots and shot off round the house as fast as he
  could go. He didnt stop for anything. I could hear the bell on his
  neck tinkling all the way to the top of Butternut Hill. That is a high
  hill just back of Buttons house. Look out for that ice, Fleetfoot! Do
  you want to tumble down?
  
  The little Brownie laughed and shook his head. It wouldnt hurt me if
  I did, said saucy Fleetfoot, but under his breath so that Jack Frost
  couldnt hear.
  
  In no time at all, went on Jack Frost, out of the house came Buttons
  himself in his night-clothes and no slippers, enough to give him his
  death of cold. And he started to hunt for Boots.
  
  It is lucky his mother didnt see him, said Fleetfoot. You know how
  particular mothers are about coats and sweaters and rubbers and all.
  
  Yes, I know, answered Jack Frost shortly. Perhaps he thought it was
  partly his fault that mothers behaved so. At any rate, he didnt seem
  pleased. Dont interrupt, Fleetfoot. Of course Buttons hadnt heard
  the bell going up Butternut Hill, so where does he go to look for
  Boots but round the barn. He thought Boots was after mice, I suppose.
  Well, I did my best to make Buttons go up Butternut Hill. I whispered
  in his ear, but he couldnt understand a word I said. He thought I
  was the wind blowing. Think of that! Then I rubbed my icicle over his
  nose and gave his cheeks and his toes a little pinch. But that didnt
  help either. He kept walking round and round the barn calling, “Boots!
  Boots!” and saying, “Ouch!” every time he stepped on a sharp stone with
  his bare feet.
  
  Poor Buttons! murmured Fleetfoot, looking down at his own pointed
  Brownie shoes that were helping him speed so swiftly over the ground.
  Poor Buttons! He must have hurt his toes.
  
  Yes, he did, answered Jack Frost, a trifle sharply. But I couldnt
  help that, you know. Now I am so busy this Autumn weather that I
  couldnt spend any more time on him. So I hurried up Butternut Hill,
  and there at the top, huddled in a tree, sat Boots. The foolish fellow
  had dreamed that a dog was chasing him. I heard him say so, talking
  to himself. There he sat and wouldnt come down. Dream or no dream,
  he was afraid that the dog was at the foot of the hill. I pinched him
  and nipped him on ears and nose and toes, but still he wouldnt move
  for me. I find that cats never are friendly with me, said Jack Frost
  thoughtfully, and a trifle sadly, too. They are too fond of the fire
  and their comfort to like me very well.
