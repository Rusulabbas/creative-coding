    <!-- I chose this image because it had a lot of detail, and I wanted to sort the pixels without losing the overall image.-->

    <!-- This is a street view image. I picked it because I thought it would be interesting to sort the pixels of an image with a strong 
     perspective, where everything converges toward the center. To be honest, I just experimented with random values and attributes until 
     I found something I liked. -->

    <!-- I chose this image because I love trying new foods with my sisters, and I wanted to pixel sort something related to that. I tried
      masking for this image, but I’m not sure if it worked perfectly. However, I liked the result because, even though the pixels were 
      rearranged, you can still see the food and people, which was my main goal. -->

    <!-- I wanted something Halloween-themed, and this image looked cool. A lot of my images had similar angles, but for this one,
      I sorted the pixels at a 90-degree angle. It worked well because the skeletons are still visible. -->

    <!-- I picked this image because pixel sorting can be a bit creepy so I picked a black-and-white image of a smiling 
     clown. I used the wave attribute to sort the pixels. If you look closely, you can still see the clown’s smile, 
     which I found fuuny and creepy. -->
